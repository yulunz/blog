I ++cook++ a lot (real cooking). However I find myself not sampling from my full pool of available recipes - only those I tried recently are considered. Good recipes will eventually lost to time. To manually set up a recipe pool with larger capacity, recipes are documented into ++cookbooks++.

The cookbook is subject to continuous amendment as me the stat-person is marching through the foreign land of software develepment.

Long, long time ago, in a land far, far away, there was a stat-person ...... anyways, let's save the tale for another time.

# Basics

## Set up SSH for Github
You want to do this because you want SSH without entering your password everytime. 
```
ssh-keygen -b <your favorite power of 2> -t <your favorite crtypo algorithm>
```
You will find a `id_rsa.pub` in `.ssh` file in your home directory. Will ya just copy the content to github on "Settings - SSH and GPG keys - New SSH key"?

### Share Your Shell Without Sharing Your Password
**Story:** The professor decided (very kindly) to let students use his research desktop for the computational complex homework. The TA came in and ask students to run some weird scripts and send a `id_rsa.pub` to him by email so that they could access the desktop. Here is how he do it.

Simply add the content of `id_rsa.pub` to `~/.ssh/<what is it again?>`.

## Download a git repo
Git personnel say ++clone++ when they mean ++download++ to enhance their geekiness. 
```
git clone <repo>
```
Please note that this will be only your copy of the original repo. You are free to mess with it, but the repo up there online will not change unless you tell git to do so.

**Story:** A colleague asks another, "my git clone is not working at all, please help." The other colleague tried in command line found nothing wrong with the repo. "What are you doing exactly?" "I clicked on clone..." "So you are using S*****Tree? Try restarting." Lessons learned. Command line champs.

## Add your changes to the ++stage++
Now you have done your job as a dev. You are eager to put them under the limelight. Git people called this staging.
```
git add <path to the file you have changed>
```
Want to add all changes at once?
```
git add -u
```
So what's on the stage?
```
git status
```
Greens are what you have on the stage. Reds are the ones you want to keep to yourself. These may be temporary files generated by your program while running. If you want them in the repo, just `git add`.


# Advanced

Now you are in the advanced land. People will assume you are a responsible adult being able to suck it up when you lose it. Well, not yet? Make a copy of your local git repo before you take adventures.
