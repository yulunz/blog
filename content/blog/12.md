We have seen some very interesting incidences like [this](https://twitter.com/mrandyngo/status/1267003300131385348?lang=en), where a man carrying an American flag was beaten, before he explicitly voices himself as either left or right, by some left demonstrators. This shows that people tend to associate Patriotism with the right, which is now almost synonymous to Trumpism.

The Trumpublicans really like Patriotism. For example, Kellyanne Conway's [twitter bio](https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) says that she is a "*Mom. Patriot. Catholic. Happy Warrior. Counselor. Survivor*". For a good reason, too. Patriotism would almost mean "America First", which is Trumpism's core message. "America First", then, would almost mean anti-immigration. Since most immigrants are not white, anti-immigration implies colored people are immigrants, and we should just anti-color, which comfortably implies white supremacy. And white supremacy is the core underlying message of Trumpism ([why](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/opinion/stephen-millers-dystopian-america.html)). For the right, Patriotism is the unquestionable moral high ground that doubles as the start a series of slippy slopes.

Patriotism shouldn't be kidnapped like this. Patriotism	lies at the core of American value, not Trumpism value. It is what really distinguishes Americans on the world stage, and it is what every American, either left or right, are told to embrace. It's very unfortunate that Patriotism is heavily politicized as a tool to polarize American people. The Americans should bring Patriotism to its original, non-partisan definition.

The responsibility to bring it back should fall on everybody, but mostly on the left. There should be voices on the left that explicitly celebrate patriotism. The previous [incidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/) of the media claiming Trump used "losers, and suckers" on veterans was a very good opportunity for the left to do so. It would not only balance the left on being patriots, but also persuade the persuadable voters, and also, most importantly, show that the Patriotism under the right's voice isn't America's Patriotism at all.
